          This is an obvious starting point, but it's a chance to help the
          interviewer understand more about you and why you love being a web
          designer. After introducing yourself, talk about your career path,
          education, previous work experience if you have it, and end with your
          interest in the job in question.

        <h4>Become a web Developer</h4>
        <p>
          Technology plays a huge role in our daily lives, from the simplest of
          apps to the most groundbreaking inventions. Every website or piece of
          software that we encounter has been built by a web developer—but what
          exactly is web development, and what does a web developer do? To the
          outside eye, it can seem like a complicated, confusing and somewhat
          inaccessible field. So, to shed some light on this fascinating
          industry, we’ve put together the ultimate introduction to web
          development and what it takes to become a fully-fledged web developer.
          In this guide, we’ll go through the basics of web development in
          detail, and show you the essential skills and tools you’ll need to
          break into the industry.

            A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of
            databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. Depending on
            the project, what customers need may be a mobile stack, a Web stack,
            or a native application stack.

            The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding,
            especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain
            sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive
            working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell
            you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. You get to
            learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff
            from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important
            because your code and your effort matters to the company.
